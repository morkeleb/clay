        <div class="subtitle">
          Understanding the benefits and challenges of code generation
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="doc-content">
        <h2>Why Code Generation?</h2>
        <p>
          Code generation fundamentally changes how we approach software
          development. Instead of carefully architecting every detail upfront,
          you can start quickly and iteratively refine patterns as they emerge.
        </p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>

        <div class="benefit-item">
          <h3>🚀 Rapid Iteration</h3>
          <p>
            You don't need to think through everything beforehand. Just start
            and slowly chisel out a pattern. The ability to experiment freely
            and go all the way without fear is liberating.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit-item">
          <h3>🔄 Global Changes</h3>
          <p>
            Found a bug or want to improve something? Change it once in the
            template, and it updates everywhere. This is especially powerful
            when you realize you need to refactor a pattern across dozens or
            hundreds of files.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit-item">
          <h3>🎯 Consistent Quality</h3>
          <p>
            Generated code maintains even quality throughout. No "morning code
            vs afternoon code" inconsistencies. Every generated file follows the
            same standards and patterns.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit-item">
          <h3>🧪 Reduced Testing Burden</h3>
          <p>
            When all UI components look and behave the same, testing becomes
            more efficient. Test one dropdown, and you've effectively tested
            them all. You can even generate tests if you want to.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit-item">
          <h3>⚡ Lightning-Fast Implementation Changes</h3>
          <p>
            Want to swap out a select box implementation? With code generation,
            it's a quick template change rather than hunting through dozens of
            files.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit-item">
          <h3>👥 Live Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            Conduct meetings with live model changes while maintaining runnable
            code. The model becomes a living document that everyone can
            understand and modify together.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit-item">
          <h3>✅ Enhanced Validation</h3>
          <p>
            We would never have achieved the level of input data validation we
            have today without code generation. Consistent patterns ensure
            nothing falls through the cracks.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="benefit-item">
          <h3>🎓 Learning Curve Similar to TDD</h3>
          <p>
            Like Test-Driven Development, code generation has a learning curve.
            But once you get into it, it doesn't feel scary anymore. It becomes
            a natural part of your workflow.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Trade-offs & Challenges</h2>

        <div class="challenge-item">
          <h3>⚠️ Overwrites Custom Code</h3>
          <p>
            Generated code will overwrite files on regeneration. You need to be
            careful about where you put custom logic. For example, if you modify
            a generated file like <code>rest.mixin.js</code>, your changes will
            be lost on the next generation.
          </p>
          <p class="tip">
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Use mixins, partials, and separate files
            for custom logic that won't be overwritten.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge-item">
          <h3>🔧 Heavier Change Process</h3>
          <p>
            Making changes becomes a bit more involved since you need to modify
            templates rather than individual files. This can feel slower
            initially but pays off when the same change needs to propagate
            everywhere.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge-item">
          <h3>📝 Template DRYness</h3>
          <p>
            It's harder to keep template files DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
            There's a temptation for copy-paste between templates, which can
            lead to maintenance issues.
          </p>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Use partials extensively and extract
            common patterns into reusable components.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge-item">
          <h3>💅 Output Polish</h3>
          <p>
            It's easy to neglect making your templates beautiful, resulting in
            output that sometimes looks "generated". If we had linted our
            templates more rigorously, we might have avoided some of these
            issues.
          </p>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Use formatters like Prettier and treat
            your templates with the same care as production code.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Best Practices</h2>

        <div class="best-practice">
          <h3>Embrace the Learning Curve</h3>
          <p>
            Give yourself time to adapt. Like TDD, code generation feels
            unfamiliar at first but becomes natural with practice.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="best-practice">
          <h3>Design for Generation</h3>
          <p>
            Structure your projects with clear boundaries between generated and
            custom code. Use mixins and hooks for customization points.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="best-practice">
          <h3>Keep Templates Clean</h3>
          <p>
            Treat templates as first-class code. Use linters, formatters, and
            code review. The quality of your templates directly impacts the
            quality of your generated code.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="best-practice">
          <h3>Iterate Fearlessly</h3>
          <p>
            One of the biggest advantages is the ability to experiment. Don't be
            afraid to try new patterns—you can always regenerate if something
            doesn't work out.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="best-practice">
          <h3>Use Version Control</h3>
          <p>
            Commit your templates and models separately from generated code.
            This makes it easy to track what changed and why.
          </p>
        </div>
