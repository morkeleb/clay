# What is Clay

Clay is a template focused code generator. Used to take a model represented in JSON and konvert it to actual code matching the model through a set of generators using handlebar templates, shell commands and file operations.

The goal is to have a consistent implementation of all model related operations in a system. Similar to how Ruby On Rails scaffolds work but backed using files, so you can with confident change the model and have all files updated.

# Usage

## Installation

I use clay as a globally installed commandline tool.

```
>  npm install -g clay-generator
```

Running `clay` will display its available commands.

```
> clay

Usage: clay [options] [command]

Options:
  -V, --version                        output the version number
  -v, --verbose                        ignore test hook
  -h, --help                           output usage information

Commands:
  test-path <model_path> <json_path>   test a json-path selector using your model
  clean <model_path> <output_path>     cleans up the output of the generators
  generate <model_path> <output_path>  runs the generators
  watch <model_path> <output_path>     runs the generators on filechanges in the models directory
  init [type] [name]                   initializes the folder with an empty .clay file or a generator
```

## Generate

The first command to know in clay is the `generate` command.

```
> clay generate <model_path> <output_path>
```

It takes the model to generate as the first input and the second input is where the model should
be generated too.

## Test-path

The test path command will allow you to test jsonpath against your specified model.
This is usefull when you are creating generators and templates.
To see what you will get from a model given a specific path.

The command will simply print the resulting model objects your path returns.

```
> clay test-path <model_path> $.model.types[*].actions[*].parameters[?\(@.type==\"array\"\)]
```

## Clean

The `clean` command will clear up all generated code based on the generators specified in the
model.

It will not undo any commandline executions that has ben run by a generator.

```
> clay clean <model_path> <output_path>
```

## Watch

If you start using clay extensivly you will notice that you want to rerun clay as soon as you make
changes to the model or any of the custom generators you might be using.

For this there is a built in watch command that follows the same structure as the generate command.

```
> clay  <model_path> <output_path>
```

Using this will make clay listen for changes under the directory specified in the model.

### Recommended directory layout for the model and custom generators

We have a directory called clay where we keep our model and our custom generators.

```
.
├── dataaccess
│   ├── generator.json
│   └── template
│       └── db.js
├── frontend
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── {{pascalCase\ name}}Components.js
│   ├── generator.json
│   ├── partials
│   │   └── form-fields.js
│   └── reducers
│       └── {{kebabCase\ name}}.reducer.js
├── mixins
│   └── default_actions.mixin.js
└── model.json
```

This makes it simple to run clay watch on the "clay directory" and work continously on the
generators and the model.

## Init

The `init` command is used to initialize a Clay project in the current directory. It creates a `.clay` file, which is essential for Clay to function properly. This file keeps track of what has been generated and allows other commands like `generate`, `clean`, and `watch` to work without requiring additional arguments.

### Usage

To initialize a Clay project, run:

```
> clay init
```

This will create a `.clay` file in the current directory.

### Initializing a Generator

You can also use the `init` command to create a new generator. For example:

```
> clay init generator <generator_name>
```

This will create a new generator directory under `clay/generators/<generator_name>` and include a `generator.json` file. The `generator.json` file will have a basic structure that you can customize to define the steps and configurations for your generator.

### Error Handling

- If a `.clay` file already exists, the `init` command will fail with an error message: `A .clay file already exists in this folder`.
- If you attempt to initialize a generator with the same name as an existing one, the command will also fail.

# Domain model

Clay takes a structured specification of a domain model and generates code based on the domain model and a given set of generators.

Clay tries to stay clear of exactly how the domain model i structured, but in order to successfully generate from the model there needs to be some structure.

The model can have includes to split it up into several files.

There is also something called mixins that allow you to make modifications to models
using simple js functions. These are usefull for convention based model properties.

The model holds a list of generators to be run for this specific model.

# Generators

Generators holds a list of steps to run.
Steps can do one of the following:

1. Generate a set of files using a handlebar template and the model
2. Run commands using the model and handlebar to modify executed commands
3. Copy existing files

the order of execution is defined in the generator

# Files

## Models

Clays models are described in a file called models.json.

The structure for describing a model in clay is as follows:

- A model contains:

- a list of generators.
- a name
- a list of mixins
- the model as a json structure

`mixin` and `include` are reserved properties on a clay model.
`mixin` is a list of functions to execute on a part of the model
`include` will replace the current part of the model with the content if a
specified file.

Example of a models.json file:

```
{
  name: 'mymodel'
  generators: [
    'documentation',
    'backend.json'
  ]
  mixins: [
    'has_created.js',
    'has_error.js'
  ]
  model: {
    events: [
      {include: 'standardevents.json'}
    ],
    types:[
      {
        name: 'order',
        mixin: [has_created, has_errors],
        commands: [
          {
            name: 'finish_order',
            raise: 'order_finished',
            parameters: [
              {
                name: 'finished'
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        fields: [
          {
            name: 'test'
          }
        ]

      }
    ]
  }
}

```

## Generators

Generators describe a sequence of steps that will be taken with the model
as input. Generators are generally installed globaly so they can be used by clay.

a generator contains:

- a list of steps
- a list of partials
- a list of formatters

Currently available generators:

- [Clay Model Generator](https://github.com/morkeleb/clay-model-documentation)

### Setting Up `generator.json`

The `generator.json` file is a critical part of Clay's functionality. It defines the steps and configurations for generating code based on your model. Below is a detailed guide on how to set up this file.

#### Structure

The `generator.json` file contains the following main sections:

- **partials**: An array of handlebar partials that can be used in templates.
- **steps**: An array of steps that define the actions to be performed during code generation.
- **formatters**: (Optional) An array of formatters to prettify the generated files.

#### Example

```json
{
  "partials": [],
  "steps": [
    {
      "runCommand": "jhipster microservice"
    },
    {
      "generate": "templates/jdl-files",
      "select": "$.jsonpath.statement"
    },
    {
      "runCommand": "jhipster import-jdl {{service.name}}",
      "select": "$.jsonpath.statement"
    },
    {
      "copy": "git+morkeleb/foundation",
      "select": "$.jsonpath.statement",
      "target": "{{microservice}}"
    }
  ],
  "formatters": ["clay-generator-formatter-prettier"]
}
```

#### Steps

Each step in the `steps` array can perform one of the following actions:

1. **Run a Command**

   - **Parameters**:
     - `runCommand` (string): The shell command to execute.
     - `npxCommand` (boolean, optional): Whether to run the command using `npx`.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "runCommand": "yo newservice",
       "npxCommand": true
     }
     ```

2. **Generate Handlebar Template**

   - **Parameters**:
     - `generate` (string): Path to the handlebar template.
     - `select` (string, optional): JSONPath to filter the model.
     - `target` (string, optional): Target path for the generated files.
     - `touch` (boolean, optional): Generate only if the file does not exist.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "generate": "templates/java{{name}}.js",
       "select": "$.model.types[*]",
       "target": "src/{{name}}.js",
       "touch": true
     }
     ```

3. **Copy Files**
   - **Parameters**:
     - `copy` (string): Source path to copy.
     - `select` (string, optional): JSONPath to filter the model.
     - `target` (string, optional): Target path for the copied files.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
       "copy": "foundation",
       "select": "$.model.types[*]",
       "target": "{{name}}/foundation"
     }
     ```

#### Validation

- Ensure all `select` fields use valid JSONPath expressions.
- Use the `test-path` command to verify your JSONPath expressions against your model.

#### Tips

- Keep your `generator.json` file organized and modular by splitting complex configurations into multiple steps.
- Use partials for reusable template components.
- Leverage formatters to ensure consistent code style in the generated files.

### Partials

The partials are handlebar partials that can be used in the templates within
the generator. These are usefull for header and footer like operations.

### Steps

The steps describe what the generator does and in which order. Steps can be one of:

- **Copy**: Copies files or directories to a target location.
- **Generate Handlebar Template**: Generates files using a handlebar template and the model.
- **Run a Command**: Executes a shell command, optionally using the model for dynamic inputs.

#### Parameters

Each step can include the following parameters:

- **runCommand** (optional): A string representing the shell command to execute.
- **npxCommand** (optional): A boolean indicating whether the command should be run using `npx`.
- **generate** (optional): A string specifying the path to the handlebar template to use for file generation.
- **touch** (optional): A boolean that, if true, ensures the file is only generated if it does not already exist.
- **select** (optional): A JSONPath string to filter the model for the step.
- **copy** (optional): A string representing the source path to copy.
- **target** (optional): A string specifying the target path for the generated or copied files.

#### Examples

1. **Copy Step**

   ```json
   {
     "copy": "foundation",
     "select": "$.model.types[*]",
     "target": "{{name}}/foundation"
   }
   ```

   This step copies the `foundation` directory for each type in the model to a dynamically generated target path based on the type's name.

2. **Run Command Step with npxCommand**

   ```json
   {
     "runCommand": "yo newservice",
     "npxCommand": true
   }
   ```

   This step runs the `yo newservice` command using `npx`.

3. **Generate Handlebar Template Step**

   ```json
   {
     "generate": "templates/java{{name}}.js",
     "select": "$.model.types[*]",
     "target": "src/{{name}}.js"
   }
   ```

   This step generates JavaScript files for each type in the model using a handlebar template located at `templates/java{{name}}.js` and saves them to the `src` directory.

4. **Generate Handlebar Template Step with touch**

   ```json
   {
     "generate": "templates/java{{name}}.js",
     "select": "$.model.types[*]",
     "target": "src/{{name}}.js",
     "touch": true
   }
   ```

   This step generates JavaScript files for each type in the model using a handlebar template, but only if the file does not already exist.

5. **Run Command Step**
   ```json
   {
     "runCommand": "echo Generating {{name}}",
     "select": "$.model.types[*]"
   }
   ```
   This step runs a shell command for each type in the model, dynamically inserting the type's name into the command.

These examples demonstrate how steps can be configured to perform specific actions during the generation process.

### Formatters

To ensure the generated files are as pretty as possible, Clay has support for external formatters.

Formatters are used to format the output before it is written to disk.
For example it could be to ensure propper indentation before writing the file.
Formatters are installed globally and the generator will require the specified formatter.

Example:

```
{
  "partials":[],
  "formatters:["clay-generator-formatter-prettier"],
  "steps":[
    {
      "runCommand": "yo newservice"
    },
    {
      "generate": "templates/html",
      "select": "jsonpath statement"
    },
    {
      "runCommand": "yo servicepart {{service.name}}",
      "select": "jsonpath statement"
    },
    {
      "copy": "foundation",
      "select": "jsonpath statement",
      "target": "{{microservice}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

Currently available formatters:

- [JavaScript / TypeScript](https://github.com/morkeleb/clay-generator-formatter-prettier)
- [Java](https://github.com/VictorHedegran/clay-generator-formatter-java)

### Templates

Clay uses the handlebars template engine to generate a files.

The paths are also handlebar template, allowing you to use values from the model or view data to write the file to the correct location.

Example of a template:

```
var command = function (user, {{ parameters }}) {
	var {{lowerCase type.name}} = repository.find('{{type.name}}', id);

	if({{lowerCase type.name}}){
		eventsource.raise('{{raises}}', [user, {{parameters}}]);
	}
}
```

### Partials

It's tedious to rewrite parts of code even in template files. To help with that clay
include all partials listed in a generator.

in the domain-documentation.html template I use the header partial as shown:

```
{{>header }}
		<h1>{{name}}</h1>
```

### Template helpers

#### json

This helper is very usefull when creating templates.
It will pretty print the json input given to it.
Allowing you to check what objects you have received to the template as you were generating.

```
<p>
  {{{json this}}}
</p>
```

#### markdown

The markdown helper method shown in the following example.

```
<p>
  {{markdown description}}
</p>
```

#### lobars

lobars and lodash string manipulation as helpers to the handlebar templating system.

```
var command = function (user, {{ parameters }}) {
	var {{lowerCase type.name}} = repository.find('{{type.name}}', id);

	if({{lowerCase type.name}}){
		eventsource.raise('{{raises}}', l[user, {{parameters}}]);
	}
}
```
